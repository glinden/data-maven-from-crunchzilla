#### Data Maven from Crunchzilla

Data Maven from Crunchzilla is a combination of a game and tutorial
with a focus on action over explanation.  When you work through Data
Maven, you dive right into playing with data and statistics.

Statistics and data analysis are increasingly important for people
working in any field. But many people shy away from statistics,
thinking it is too difficult or too boring for them. Data Maven
demystifies statistics.

Data Maven is more of a game than a tutorial. To play, you answer
questions. Looking at data provides your answers.  Statistics will be
your tool, showing you where to look. As you answer questions, you'll
discover new questions.

You'll learn more about how to answer questions.  As you play with
Data Maven, you should start to have an intuition and curiosity for
answering questions using data and statistics.

Data Maven from Crunchzilla is publicly available to play for free
at

http://www.crunchzilla.com/

We decided to make a version of code for the tutorial itself available for
others to modify, use, and translate.

If you want to create your own lessons or translate the existing
lessons to a language other than English, the lesson content is
entirely contained in datamaven-lessons.js in a large JSON
file. Changing just that file will allow you to create your own lesson
content. If you want to change or translate the help menus or title,
edit the index.html file.

To deploy your modified code to your own webserver, just upload all
the files to your favorite host. The code only contacts the server
once at initialization to download all the lessons (intentionally,
allowing people to play offline if they want to). You don't need any
special configuration; just upload all the files like this was a web
page.

If you build anything using the code for Data Maven from
Crunchzilla, it'd be nice to credit Crunchzilla.com for the original
code, though you don't have to.  If you want to show off anything you
build using this code, we'd love to hear from you
(contact@crunchzilla.com).
