      <h3>How to Play</h3> 
      Too many people think statistics is either boring or useless.
      Data Maven from Crunchzilla helps build an intuition
      and spark a curiosity for statistics and data. At the end of
      Data Maven, you'll not only know a bit about statistics, but
      also maybe even start to think of statistics as fun!
      <br><br> 
      It's more of a game than a tutorial.  To play, you answer
      questions and solve problems. Statistics is your tool, and data
      provides your answers. Once you have the tools and know where to
      look, you'll be ready to take on your own questions.
      <br><br> 
      It's easy to play.  Follow the instructions and do what
      Data Maven says.  Click on the words Data Maven is saying or the
      Next button to go to the next lesson. Click on the Back button
      to go back to a previous lesson. You can jump to a specific
      lesson or back to the beginning using the "Lesson Sections"
      link.
      <br><br>
      Data Maven saves what lesson you are on, so feel free
      to stop at any time and come back later.  As long as you come
      back on the same browser on the same machine, you'll get back to
      your lesson.
      <br><br>
      Try it out! You'll be surprised by how interesting and easy it can
      be to answer questions using data and statistics. Have fun!

      <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
      <b>What is this? What is Data Maven from Crunchzilla?</b>
      <br><br>
      Data Maven is an interactive tutorial where you explore data and statistics. 
      <br><br>
      So many people have tried to
      learn about statistics, only to get bogged down in probability, theory, and math,
      without feeling that they were able to do anything with it. Data Maven is
      an intuitive game-like tutorial where you try answering questions with data and statistics.
      The focus is on action. You answer questions, look at data, and discover how
      to use statistics as your tool to do even more.
      <br><br>
      <b>Why aren't you telling me all the details about statistics?</b>
      <br><br> 
      There are already a lot of tutorials and textbooks out
      there that teach statistics with technical, in-depth
      explanations of probability, sampling, confidence intervals,
      distributions, hypothesis testing, regression, and so on.  If
      you want that, there are many choices available, many of which
      are excellent supplements to Data Maven.
      <br><br>
      What is hard to find is a tutorial that is fun, immersive, and gets you immediately 
      working with lots of real data. Data Maven skips a lot of the explanation you 
      can get elsewhere and instead jumps straight into
      what you can do with data and statistics.
      <br><br> By the time you finish Data Maven, you should be curious for
      more. At the end, there is a list of other resources to go to to
      learn more about statistics, data analysis, and data science.
      <br><br>
      <b>Why doesn't this work perfectly on an iPad (or other mobile device)?</b>
      <br><br>
      Data Maven will work and is playable on many mobile devices, but 
      it isn't designed for mobile. Why not?
      <br><br>
      Mostly because mobile screens are so small. It's hard to
      read a lot on tiny mobile screens, even harder to see
      detailed charts, and can even be a challenge to accurately
      select the answer you want in the quizzes.  Because of that,
      Data Maven is designed to work on mobile, but not optimized
      for mobile.
      <br><br>
      <b>Data is plural, isn't it? Shouldn't you say "data are", not "data is"?</b>
      <br><br> Data was originally the plural of datum.  Years ago,
      people did used to say "data are". Nowadays, the word datum is
      rarely used, and the word data is treated as a mass noun similar
      to the word information (e.g.  "information is great and, golly
      gee, data is too").
      <br><br>The Oxford English Dictionary states that data usually
      takes a singular verb in current standard English. Most style
      guides either favor "data is" or say either is acceptable. And,
      "data are" sounds wrong to most younger people. So,
      Data Maven from Crunchzilla uses "data is".
      <br><br>
      <b>Where can I learn more about programming?</b>
      <br><br>
      <a href="http://crunchzilla.com/code-maven">Code Maven</a> is a fun way
      to learn more about programming and Javascript.
      There also are already a lot of tutorials and textbooks out on the Web that teach Javascript
      programming, many of which are excellent supplements to Code Maven.

      <h3>Privacy Policy</h3> 

      Data Maven is extremely protective of privacy.  Data Maven
      keeps almost no information about people who use the website.
      <br><br>
      Data Maven does not require registration.  It does not have
      your e-mail address.  It does not know who you are.  When you
      use Data Maven, you are essentially anonymous.
      <br><br>
      Data Maven does not use cookies.  If you leave the website and
      come back, there is a feature that will get you back to the
      lesson you were on.  That does not use cookies.  It is done
      using HTML5 Local Storage, which stores data on your machine,
      not remotely on the webservers.  Data Maven does not even know
      what lesson you were on or how many lessons people using
      Data Maven have completed, and it is a bit of a shame that we do
      not (we love data), but that is how seriously we take privacy.
      <br><br> 
      Like nearly all websites, Data Maven has web server logs that
      may contain the IP address used to access the web server.  That
      is standard in nearly all webservers and not an attempt at data
      collection.
      <br><br>
      In keeping with standard language in privacy policies,
      personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to a
      third party unless required by law and we may update this policy
      from time to time at our sole discretion.
      <br><br>
      We are very protective of your privacy.  We like it that way.

      <h3>Old Browser Warning</h3>
      Oh my.  Data Maven does not like your web browser.  Your browser
      is really old.  You need a new web browser.
      <br><br> 
      Data Maven likes <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>
      and <a href="http://mozilla.com/firefox">Firefox</a>.  You can
      play with Data Maven if you have those.  Go get them and let's play!
      <br><br>
      Data Maven uses modern web features such as SVG and animations
      for the charts and graphics. Modern browsers support those, but
      some older browsers such as Internet Explorer 8 on Windows XP and older 
      mobile devices will not be able to play. You can play if you
      install Chrome or Firefox or if you use a different computer
      or device.
